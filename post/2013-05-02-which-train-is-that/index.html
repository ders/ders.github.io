                        <p>Straight out of college, I went on a summer backpacking trip to Europe.
Well, it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a backpacking trip, as (1) my bag wasn&rsquo;t a backpack, and (2) I actually spent two months in one place attending a language program, but that&rsquo;s another story.</p>

<p>My ticket back home was out of London&rsquo;s Heathrow airport, and since I was in Bavaria at the time, I had a major train + ferry + train journey just to get my flight.
I had the journey carefully researched and perfectly timed so that I&rsquo;d be on the ferry just as my rail pass expired.
The journey, though long, was largely without incident, but something that happened on the tube from Liverpool Street to Heathrow left a lasting impression.</p>

<p>I had figured out in advance which train I needed to catch. I&rsquo;ll guess now that it was the Circle Line to South Kensingon, changing to the Piccadilly Line.
I followed all the signs carefully and got myself to the correct platform.
I noticed that there were other lines operating on the same track, so I had to make sure that I got on the correct train.</p>

<p>Within a couple of minutes, a train arrived.  I looked to see whether or not it was a Circle Line train, but wait.
There was no marking whatsoever.  No Circle Line, no Metropolitan Line, nothing.
And yet, busy Londoners were getting on and off, some were waiting for a different train, and they all obviously knew something about this mystery train that I didn&rsquo;t &ndash;
namely what line it was running.</p>

<p>I finally asked a woman who was standing nearby if she could tell me what train this was.  Predictably, she looked at me as if I were an idiot.
She was silent for a few seconds, and then without moving her head she glanced slightly upward and answered me.  &ldquo;Metropolitan.&rdquo;  End of conversation.</p>

<p>You see, in New York, the line number/letter and destination are clearly visible on the outside of every subway car.
In fact, everywhere I&rsquo;d travelled, every bus, subway, and tram  was labeled in this fasion.
In New York at the time, looking at the train itself was the <em>only</em> way to know if it was the train you wanted; fancy platform displays were as of yet a thing of the future.  It had simply never occurred to me that there was another way.</p>

<p>The train information signs in the London tube station were large enough to read easily but also small enough to miss completely if you didn&rsquo;t know they were there.
Had I gone to London with this one simple bit of information &ndash; that there is train information displayed above the platform &ndash; I could have saved myself this small embarrassment and the possibility of getting on the wrong train.</p>

<p>This, my friends, is an exact parallel of what&rsquo;s happening in my workplace nowadays.</p>
